#  AutoOTP-TextField

Try to use another way to build auto-fill field, obviously this way is more simple and more elegant.<br>
The key is to build a temporary TextField in background, and receive any input from keyboard.
By extending the Binding, to implement a limit method to limit the number of chars to six digits through **prefix**.
And then have other Text take part of that field.
