#  AutoOTP-TextField

Try to use another way to build auto-fill field, obviously this way is more simple and more elegant.<br>
The key is build a temporary TextField in background, and receive any input from keyboard.
By extending the Binding, to provide a limit method to limit the number of characters to six digits through the prefix.
And then have other Text take part of that field.
